This script trys to help you open a C project quickly and automatically initialize the working environment, such as creating cscope, ctags files, files_list, etc.

More work is needed. Now the script contains the following functionalitiy:

1. Initialize the project, which contains recording the work directory, mapping useful keys, etc.
2. Create cscope.out files,  [ cscope.in.out, cscope.po.out are also included]
3. Create ctags files, which is useful for omni completion, make sure you have install the omnicompletion script
4. Update the project. <F8>u
5. Save the working status(just use "mksession" command). <F8>s
6. Safely close the project. <F8>q
7. Count source lines. (only take the advantage of  "wc" command)  _wc
8. Clear the project, nothing extra files left. (no cscopes, no files.list, no session.vim...)  <F8>c
9. Recover from the last working status.

Support a menu named "Project". Read more from the script file.  More details about usage will be added soon.
